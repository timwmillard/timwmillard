From a very young age, Mickey Mouse was my hero.  I just loved all Disney cartoons and movies.  At one stage early on, I even through I would become an animator.  During early school, I would draw cartoon but I got to a point where I didn't see much improvement.  Looking back, I just need to push through that fase but instead I gave up.  Later on in life, early thirties, after studing lots of motivation talks, I realised the only reason I can't draw was lack of practic and it's never too late to start.  So I ventured off to start practice my drawing again.
