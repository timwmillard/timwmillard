For many year I have been learning from others but not it's time to start to pass my learning onto other new commers.  Does this mean I stop learning, of course not, that is an forever ongoing process.  An in fact this blog will help me learn and develop my skills also.  It's one thing to learn and understan something, but it's a completely different leave to teach and document something you though you knew fairly well.  So this is a double edged sword, I will teach and learn at the same time.
